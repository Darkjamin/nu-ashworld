- character starting combat gets a free "surprise turn" at the beginning
- defender then gets a turn to defend themselves

- after that:
  - all participants get a turn based on their `sequence` stat
  - characters with higher `sequence` act earlier than those with lower `sequence`
  - but everybody has a turn before anyone goes again
