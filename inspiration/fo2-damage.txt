ND = net damage
RD = random damage produced from weapons hit damage range
RB = ranged bonus (RB=0 unless player has bonus ranged damage perk)
X = ammo damage multiplier
Y = ammo damage divisor
CM = critical hit damage multiplier (if no critical hit then CM=2, otherwise assigned value from critical hit table)
CD = combat difficulty multiplier (easy = 75, normal = 100, hard = 125)
AI = 1 if critical hit which ignores armor, otherwise 0
ADT = armor damage threshold value
ADR = armor damage resistance value
RM = ammo resistance modifier (only value allowed to be negative or positive in this equation)

ND = ((RD+RB) * (X/Y) * (CM/2) * (CD/100) - ADT/max(5*AI, 1)) * (100 - max((ADR/max(5*AI, 1) + RM),0) / 100)
rounded to nearest whole number

if using HtH attack:
  - bonus from "Bonus HtH Damage" perk is added to Melee Damage statistic
  - any damage bonuses from Special Unarmed Attacks (like `Hammer Punch`) is adde to the initially rolled damage figure (RD in the above formula)





damage:
  - damage really done = hit damage - damage threshold - floor((hit damage - damage threshold) * damage resistance %)
  -                      42         - 8                - floor((42 - 8) * 60%)
  -                      34                            - floor(34 * 60%)
  -                      34                            - floor(20.4)
  -                      34                            - 20
  -                    = 14

ammo:
- JHP is superior
- FMP is second best
- forget AP ammo

burst:
- armor will absorb damage from each bullet and then add up the unabsorbed damage to give total damage dealt
  (as opposed to total damage being calculated and then being reduced)
- burst shots are uneffective against heavily armoured targets because of this

cripple:
  - legs: harder time alking around
  - 1 arm: unable to use 2h weapons
  - 2 arms: unable to use 1h weapons (only unarmed left as an option)
  - eyes: reduced Perception levels

male hit in groin -> fall down

ammo or weapon vs armor is very important
* lightly armored: you can attack unarmed or with melee weapon that doesn't consume ammo
* normally: regular shots, targeted and/or burst shots if possible and effective
* armoured enemies: use weapons tha thave good penetration PPK12/M72, G11(e), Vindicator, Plasma Rifles, YK42B

* AP ammo seems better for armoured targets, but there are negative modifiers to damage with AP ammo
* AP ammo penetrates better than JHP ammo, but JPH is superior
* AP and Explosive rockets seem to deal the same amount of damage

- hunting rifle is an early encountered sniping weapon, but outgunned later
- FN-FAL with night sight = decent mid-range
- Assault Rifle (extended magazine) = mid-range
- Sniper Rifle = long-range
- M72 = endgame <3

- burst shotguns for short distance sniping
  - great for mid armored targets
- Pancor Jackhammer
- Combat Shotgun
- H&K CAWS

- Plasma rifle - no armor can withstand it except Tesla?, 4 AP per shot
- Pulse rifle - unstoppable by any armor

- aimed shots > normal shots (if you can hit at all ofc)

- long-range weapons have a negative modifier for close range (keep this?)



- sledgehammer or rippers: against unarmed
- aim for legs, after crippling score aimed shots at head/eyes
